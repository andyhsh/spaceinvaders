# Space Invaders

My first project crafted for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. A Space Invaders clone for the web. Key technologies used in this project include HTML, CSS, and plain old vanilla Javascript (no jQuery!).

## Demo

Start blasting aliens by clicking on the link:
